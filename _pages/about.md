## 🔬 Research Interests

My research sits at the intersection of **language modeling**, and **quantum/classical many-body physics**, with interests in:

- Recurrent Neural Network & Transformer‑based wavefunctions for many-body simulation.
- Generative-enhanced combinatorial optimization.

## 📝 Selected Publications

- **“Recurrent neural network wave functions”**  
  *Phys. Rev. Research 2, 023358 (2020)*  
  Introduces a variational ansatz for many-body quantum systems using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Demonstrates that RNN-based wave functions can accurately capture ground-state properties—including energy, correlations, and entanglement—in both 1D and 2D spin systems, achieving performance on par with traditional methods like DMRG and QMC.

- **“Variational neural annealing”**  
  *Nature Machine Intelligence 3, 952–961 (2021)*  
  Presents a classical/quantum variational framework that bridges ideas from annealing algorithms and autoregressive generative models (e.g., RNNs). This approach outperforms traditional annealing methods on spin-glass optimization problems, enabling neural networks to effectively explore complex energy landscapes.
