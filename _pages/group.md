## ðŸš€ Prospective Students

We are looking for curious and driven students interested in working at the intersection of **language modeling**, **machine learning**, and **quantum or classical many-body physics**. If you're excited about using modern computational tools to tackle fundamental problems in physics, I encourage you to get in touch.

### Undergraduate Students

There are several opportunities for undergraduates to engage in research at the interface of physics and machine learning:

- Projects can count as **co-op placements**.
- Many opportunities are **paid**, and funding can be arranged.

**Examples of funding opportunities:**
- [Undergraduate Student Research Award (USRA)](https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/current-undergraduates/undergraduate-research-opportunities) â€” for Canadian citizens and permanent residents
- [Mathematics Undergraduate Research Award (MURA)](https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/current-undergraduates/undergraduate-research-opportunities) â€” open to all students at the Math Faculty of UWaterloo.

If you're interested, please contact me early so we can plan a project and apply for funding if needed.
