## 🚀 Prospective Students

<!-- We are looking for curious and driven students interested in working at the intersection of **language modeling**, **machine learning**, and **quantum or classical many-body physics**. If you're excited about using modern computational tools to tackle fundamental problems in physics, I encourage you to get in touch. -->

### Undergraduate Students

For Winter 26 and Spring 26, internship positions have been already filled. If you're interested in Fall 26 or after, feel free to contact me so that we can plan a project and apply for funding if needed.

There are several opportunities for undergraduates to engage in research at the interface of physics and machine learning:

- Projects can count as **co-op placements**.
- Many opportunities are **paid**, and funding can be arranged.

**Examples of funding opportunities:**
- [Undergraduate Student Research Award (USRA)](https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/current-undergraduates/undergraduate-research-opportunities) — for Canadian citizens and permanent residents
- [Mathematics Undergraduate Research Award (MURA)](https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/current-undergraduates/undergraduate-research-opportunities) — open to all students at the Math Faculty of UWaterloo.
